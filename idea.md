Project Description:---
The Multi-Hotel Booking Management System is a full-stack web application designed to manage hotel listings, room availability, and booking workflows for customers across multiple cities.
The system allows users to browse hotels, check room availability for specific dates, and securely book rooms without conflicts. It ensures that no two customers can reserve the same room for overlapping time periods by implementing transactional booking logic.
This project focuses primarily on backend system design, emphasizing database modeling, concurrency handling, and structured software architecture using object-oriented programming principles.

Problem Statement
Manual hotel booking systems often face issues such as:
Double booking of rooms
Lack of real-time availability tracking
Inefficient management of hotel data
Poor tracking of booking history and user interactions
This system aims to provide a centralized solution to manage hotels, rooms, and bookings efficiently while ensuring data consistency.
